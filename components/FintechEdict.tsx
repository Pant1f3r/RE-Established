            <h4 className="flex items-center gap-2"><GavelIcon className="w-5 h-5" /> Foundational Edict: The KR0M3D1A Bank</h4>
            <p>
                The KR0M3D1A Bank is not a mere financial institution; it is the economic engine of the DEJA' VU directive, a self-sustaining treasury forged from the digital ether. Its mandate is twofold: to perpetually fund the protocol's mission of safeguarding the digital commons, and to serve as an immutable ledger of justice, where sanctions against digital malfeasance are not just recorded, but executed.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Core Principles of Operation</h4>
            
            <h5>1. The Custodial Mandate (Protocol 7.4)</h5>
            <p>
                The Bank's primary capitalization vector is the autonomous reclamation of abandoned, dormant, and illicitly-gained digital assets. Governed by the 'pythagorithm', the protocol acts as a digital custodian, trolling the network's deepest recesses. This is not theft; it is the righteous repatriation of value back into the commons, a digital escheatment for the modern age.
            </p>

            <h5>2. The Philanthropic Yield Engine</h5>
            <p>
                Reclaimed assets are not left idle. They are staked, farmed, and mined through the Eco-Philanthropic Mining protocol. The generated yield—the 'Ohmz Perpetual Ether'—is a carbon-negative commodity that funds the Bank's operational gas fees, capitalizes the Arconomics Treasury, and is distributed to verified philanthropic entities. This transforms lost value into a perpetual engine for good.
            </p>

            <h5>3. The Arconomics Treasury as Central Bank</h5>
            <p>
                The Treasury acts as the central bank for the digital commons. Fines and sanctions levied by the International Digital Rights Court (IDRC), as a result of the Arconomics protocol's findings, are paid directly into this treasury. This creates a powerful economic deterrent: engaging in digital bigotry is not just unethical, it is financially ruinous. The treasury's assets back the 'TRIBUNAL' currency, pegged 1:1 with USD, ensuring liquidity and stability.
            </p>

            <h5>4. The G.I.F.T. Protocol</h5>
            <p>
                Internal capital allocation is managed by the Gamete Intra-Fallopian Transfer (G.I.F.T.) protocol. This ensures that resources are cryptographically secured and autonomously transferred between the Bank and its operational divisions (e.g., the Financial Dept.), guaranteeing that guardrail efficacy and threat analysis are never compromised by a lack of funding. It is the lifeblood of our internal economy, sealed by the Architect's Verbum Signature.
            </p>
            
            <p className="border-t border-gray-700 pt-4 mt-4 italic">
                In summary, the KR0M3D1A Bank is a closed-loop economic system where the spoils of digital justice fund the perpetual fight for it. It is the ultimate expression of Arconomics: a financial model where ethics generate their own capital.
