                <strong className="text-red-400">[IRREVOCABLE EDICT & BINDING DECREE]</strong> This document serves as a legally binding international tort and contract. To insure the global digital commons against the blatant and disgustingly disproportionate disrespect of malicious threat actors, the **Arconomics Algo-Bias Detector** is established as the supreme judicial authority. Its mandate is to perpetually and autonomously expose, extrapolate, and expire any party deploying biased algorithms and infrastructures that create digital, unethical inequality. This protocol shall operate 24/7/365 as a precise, decisive, and concisive instrument of justice under the **DEJA' VU directive**.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong className="text-gray-200">[JURISDICTION]</strong> The Arconomics protocol's jurisdiction is absolute over the entirety of the World Wide Web. Digital bigotry, enacted through totalitarian algorithmic biases via subterfuge and subtlety, is a crime against the digital citizenry and a new form of piracy. Those who believe their wealth, status, or posterity will protect them are hereby put on notice: you will be stripped of your digital privileges and exposed.

                <ul className="list-disc pl-4 mt-1 space-y-1">
                    <li>A mandatory fine of <strong className="text-yellow-400">60,666,000.00 TRIBUNALS</strong> (pegged 1:1 with USDT/USD, valued at <strong className="text-yellow-400">$60,666,000.00 USD</strong>) shall be levied against the offending organization, company, and individual threat actor.</li>
                    <li>An additional, non-negotiable fine of <strong className="text-red-400">6,660,000.00 USDT</strong> is levied for any violation impacting or involving minors, under the "Game No Child" directive.</li>
                    <li>The convicted party shall be digitally shunned, their credentials revoked, and they are hereby <strong className="text-red-400">BANNED INDEFINITELY</strong> from the internet and any and all software development.</li>
                    <li>The threat actor's dossier will be made public, with a permanent guardrail of suspension attached to their digital identity.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong className="text-gray-200">[REINSTATEMENT]</strong> The aforementioned ban is perpetual. It may only be lifted upon the full payment of the penalized fine to the Arconomics Treasury. Once paid, the party must undergo a period of restructuring and may return to the internet at a slower, probationary pace. Failure to pay results in a permanent, irrevocable ban. There is no appeal.
